# Wind Farm Power Forecasting

Welcome to the Wind Farm Power Forecasting project repository! This project aims to forecast the power generation of three different wind farms for user-defined horizons using a multi-step recursive forecasting approach with XGBoost.

## Project Components

### Datasets
- We have included datasets for the three studied wind farms. These datasets are used for training and evaluating the forecasting model.

### Model
- The project includes the trained XGBoost model used for power forecasting. The model has been trained on historical data from the wind farms.

### Notebook
- The Jupyter notebook used to train the XGBoost model is provided in the repository. You can explore the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps in this notebook.

### Slides
- Slides containing performance metrics and insights from the forecasting model are included. These slides provide an overview of the project and its outcomes.

### Flask Code and HTML Files
- The Flask code and HTML files constitute the web application interface for accessing the power forecasting functionality. Users can input wind farm IDs and forecasting horizons to receive power generation predictions.

### Postman Environment and Documentation
- We have created a Postman environment and documented the API endpoints for easy integration and testing. The documentation provides details on how to interact with the forecasting API.

## Usage
To use the Wind Farm Power Forecasting application:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies as mentioned in the requirements file.
3. Run the Flask application to start the server.
4. Access the web interface through your browser and input wind farm IDs and forecasting horizons to get power generation predictions.
